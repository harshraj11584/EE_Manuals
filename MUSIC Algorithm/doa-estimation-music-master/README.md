Estimation of direction of arrivals (DOA) using the MUSIC algorithm

MUSIC stands for MUltiple SIgnal Classification. It is a subspace-based algorithm used for estimating the direction of arrivals (DOA) of same-frequency narrowband sources arriving to a sensor array. For simplicity we assume that the sensors form an array and are positioned in a linear fashion, although more complicated array structures is possible.

This was a MATLAB project for Linear Algebra course at Shiraz University which was lectured by Dr. Alireza Masnadi-Shirazi back in Spring 2017 semester. The project guide, a related paper, and a tutorial are also included.
