    % between the noise variance and the accuracy of estimation, i.e., the latter
    % decreases as we increase the former. This is because the peaks are became
    % less sharp and some fake peaks are generated in some cases.
    
    % If we start from the largest eigen value to the smallest one in the 
    % corresponding diagonal matrix and calculate the difference between
    % i-th and (i-1)-th eigen values, we observe that for low noise cases,  
    % there are approximately M-N larger eigen values which among them, the  
    % difference between i-th and (i-1)-th one is much greater than the
    % corresponding figure for the remaining eigen values. Hence we can
